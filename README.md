# Desarrollo y Arquitecturas Web
>Simon game

## Introduction
This project aims to develop an imitation of the iconic traditional game "Simon" using web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. "Simon" is a memory and skill game that challenges players to follow increasingly complex sequences, where they must repeat patterns of colors and sounds generated by the machine. This is a project carried out for the subject "Desarrollo y Arquitecturas Web" for the "Universidad Abierta Interamericana"

## Game Description
The game "Simon" consists of a series of colored buttons (usually four) arranged in a table. Each button emits a sound and lights up when activated. The game starts with a sequence of colors and sounds generated randomly. The player must repeat that sequence exactly as presented. With each round passed, the sequence lengthens, increasing the game's difficulty.

## Project Objective
The objective of this project is to recreate the "Simon" game experience using web technologies such as HTML for the game's structure, CSS for visual design and presentation, and JavaScript for game logic and user interaction.

## Project Features
The "Simon" project must comply with the following features set by the instructor:

1. **Clean and Strict Code:** The latest HTML5, CSS3, and ES5 practices and standards will be followed to ensure clean, well-organized, and easy-to-maintain code.

2. **Consistency in Comments, Commits, and Code Styles:** Clear and consistent nomenclature will be maintained in comments, commits, and code styles to facilitate collaboration and project understanding.

3. **Responsiveness and Aesthetics of the Game and Website:** The game's design will be responsive using Flexbox to adapt to different screen sizes and devices, ensuring a pleasant user experience.

4. **Fully Functional Single-Player Game:** Players will be allowed to enter their name before starting the game, validating that it has at least 3 letters to proceed.

5. **Add Score for Each Correctly Pressed Color Light:** A record of the points obtained by the player for correctly pressing the colors in the generated sequence will be kept.

6. **Detect When the Correct Sequence Is Not Pressed:** A modal indicating that the player has lost will be displayed, with a button to restart the game.

7. **Creation of a Contact Page:** A contact page will be included with a form allowing users to enter their name, email, and message, and upon submission, the system's default email sending tool will open.

8. **Contact Form Validations:** Validations will be performed on the contact form to ensure that the name is alphanumeric, the email is valid, and the message has more than 5 characters.

9. **Add a Link to the GitHub Page:** A link will be added in the game to direct players to the GitHub page where the game's code is hosted. The link will open in a new browser tab.

10. **Display the Current Level on the Screen:** The current sequence number will be displayed on the screen so that the player has a reference of the level they are on.

11. **Add a Timer at the Start of Each Game:** A timer will be implemented for each game and used to deduct points from the winning games, ensuring that the final score is calculated considering the elapsed time. A penalty will be applied for the time taken.

12. **Use LocalStorage to Remember Information:** LocalStorage will be used to remember the name, score, level, and date and time of the games. This will allow keeping a record of the games played.

13. **Add a Button to Display a Popup with the List of Games and Rankings:** A button will be included that, when pressed, will display a popup with the list of recorded games, showing players, scores, and dates. The ranking will be sorted by score.

14. **Add the Option to Sort the Ranking by Date or Score:** Players will be allowed to choose how the ranking is sorted, either by date or score.

## Tools and Technologies
The project will be developed using the following technologies:

1. **HTML:** To create the game's structure, including the colored buttons and interface elements.

2. **CSS:** To style and format the game's interface with colors, fonts, and overall design.

3. **JavaScript:** For game logic, sequence generation, user interaction, score tracking, and levels.

## Delivery and Evaluation
The project will be delivered in the form of a website and must be hosted on a server to be accessible online. The evaluation of the project will be based on the functionality, design, and usability of the application.

## Conclusions
Upon completing the project, students will have acquired skills in web development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as experience in implementing programming logic and creating interactive interfaces. Additionally, they will appreciate the importance of design and architecture in web application development.
